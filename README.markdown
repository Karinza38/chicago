# Chicago

    It's my kind of town!
    - Sinatra

Yeah, we're real clever. We're also from ["The city in mid-west best city in the whole wide wide world"](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lupefiasco/gogogadgetflow.html) ... which makes us double the clever.

## What what?

### Sinatra runtime app

In your Sinatra app, do this:

    require 'chicago'

And you'll get some helpful Sinatra extensions and helpers.

### Sinatra testing

If you're using Shoulda in your tests of your Sinatra app, do this:

    require 'chicago/shoulda'

... and you'll get a bunch of cool Shoulda macros for testing specific Sinatra stuff.
